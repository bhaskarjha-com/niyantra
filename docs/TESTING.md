## 16. Cycle Tracking & Usage Intelligence (Phase 7)

### 16.1 Schema Migration (v3→v4)
- [ ] Start server with existing v3 database → no errors
- [ ] Check SQLite: `SELECT * FROM antigravity_reset_cycles` works (empty table)
- [ ] `PRAGMA user_version` returns `4`

### 16.2 Cycle Creation
- [ ] Enable auto-capture → first poll creates cycles for each model
- [ ] Server log shows: `Created new cycle model=... initialUsage=X.X`
- [ ] Manual snap also creates/updates cycles

### 16.3 Reset Detection
- [ ] Wait for a natural model reset (5h cycle) or observe during active use
- [ ] Server log shows: `Detected model reset model=... reason="reset_time shifted"`
- [ ] Activity log shows `model_reset` event with purple badge
- [ ] Old cycle is closed, new cycle is created

### 16.4 `/api/usage` Endpoint
- [ ] `GET /api/usage` returns JSON with `models` array and `budgetForecast`
- [ ] Each model has: `modelId`, `label`, `group`, `remainingFraction`, `usagePercent`
- [ ] Each model has: `resetTime`, `timeUntilReset`, `cycleAge`, `cycleSnapshots`
- [ ] `hasIntelligence` is `false` until 30+ min of tracking data
- [ ] `completedCycles` increments after each detected reset
- [ ] `peakCycle` tracks the highest usage observed in any cycle
- [ ] `GET /api/usage?account=1` filters by account ID

### 16.5 Rate Intelligence (requires 30+ min of auto-capture)
- [ ] After 30+ minutes: `hasIntelligence` becomes `true`
- [ ] `currentRate` shows non-zero value (usage fraction per hour)
- [ ] `projectedUsage` shows estimated usage at reset
- [ ] If projected > 95%: `projectedExhaustion` is non-null

### 16.6 Intelligence Badges (Quota Cards)
- [ ] Expand a model detail row → if `hasIntelligence = true`:
  - [ ] Blue **rate badge** appears: `X.X%/hr`
  - [ ] Green/amber/red **projection badge**: `→XX%`
  - [ ] If approaching exhaustion: pulsing red **exhaustion badge**: `⚠ Xh`
- [ ] If `hasIntelligence = false` (< 30 min data): no intelligence badges shown
- [ ] Badges update on page reload and after each snap

### 16.7 Budget Forecast
- [ ] Set budget to $200 in Settings
- [ ] Navigate to Overview tab → **Budget Forecast** card shows
- [ ] Shows: burn rate/day, day X of Y, current spend
- [ ] Green styling when on track, red when over budget
- [ ] Remove budget (set to 0) → Budget Forecast card disappears

### 16.8 Tracker + Agent Integration
- [ ] Enable auto-capture → tracker processes each poll automatically
- [ ] Disable auto-capture → tracker still processes manual snaps
- [ ] Restart server → tracker reinstantiates, resumes from DB state
- [ ] Multiple accounts → each account tracks cycles independently

---

## 17. MCP Server (Phase 8)

### 17.1 CLI Subcommand
- [ ] `niyantra mcp` starts without error (logs "MCP server starting" to stderr)

- [ ] Ctrl+C gracefully shuts down the MCP server

### 17.2 Initialize Handshake

- [ ] `{"model": "Claude Sonnet"}` → finds matching model with remaining %
- [ ] `{"model": "nonexistent"}` → returns `found: false` with helpful message
- [ ] Empty model → error message asking to provide model name

### 17.6 usage_intelligence Tool
- [ ] Returns all models with group, remaining, reset time
- [ ] `hasIntelligence` correctly reflects 30-min threshold
- [ ] When intelligence available: shows rate, projection, cycle info

### 17.7 budget_forecast Tool
- [ ] With budget set: returns burn rate, projected spend, on-track status
- [ ] Without budget: returns `hasBudget: false` with setup instructions

### 17.8 best_model Tool
- [ ] `{"group": "claude_gpt"}` → recommends model with highest remaining
- [ ] Shows alternatives with their remaining percentages
- [ ] `{"group": "invalid"}` → returns `found: false` with valid group list
- [ ] Empty group → error message listing available groups

### 17.9 Client Integration
- [ ] Add to Claude Desktop config:
  ```json
  {"mcpServers":{"niyantra":{"command":"path/to/niyantra.exe","args":["mcp"]}}}
  ```
- [ ] Restart Claude Desktop → niyantra tools appear in tool list
- [ ] Ask "What's my Windsurf quota?" → Claude invokes `quota_status`

- [ ] Starting a Claude Code session → `~/.niyantra/data/claude-statusline.json` created
- [ ] Agent poll picks up data → `GET /api/claude/status` returns snapshot
- [ ] Disabling bridge → settings.json restored, data file cleaned

### 18.3 Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Overview tab shows Claude Code card when bridge enabled
